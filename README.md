This is a file compressor project which uses Huffman Coding Algorithm used for File Compression and Decompression

- Encoding: Implement Huffman encoding to compress a text file. Create a frequency table of characters, build a Huffman tree, and assign codes to characters.
- Decoding: Develop the capability to decode Huffman-encoded files. Traverse the Huffman tree to reconstruct the original text.
